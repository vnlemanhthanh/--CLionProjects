In the following lessons, you will learn about one of 
the cornerstones of the C++ language â€“ memory management.
All the data used by a program, including all the variables and arrays, is stored in the memory.
The ability to precisely control how memory is allocated and freed 
during the run of the program is one of the key features of the C++ language,
which allows C++ programmers to develop performance-critical software.
In the next few lessons, you will learn more about how memory is organized and how to manage its usage. 
In particular, you will learn the following topics:

* Concepts of the size of a type and the address of a variable.
* Pointers and pointer arithmetic.
* Memory layout of the program: static, stack, and heap memory regions.
* Dynamic memory allocation and freeing.
* Various potential memory-related bugs and the ways to prevent them.
