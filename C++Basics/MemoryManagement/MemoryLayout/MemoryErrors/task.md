## Memory-Related Bugs and How to Avoid Them

Manual memory management in C/C++ gives programmers great power, 
but with this power comes great responsibility!
Mistakes in memory management can lead to various issues, 
such as crashes, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.
In this step, we will give examples of some common memory-related bugs, 
and then we will show how CLion IDE, with the help of great third-party tools,
can help you discover and fix these nasty bugs!

### Address Escape

You are already familiar with the _address escape_ memory error.
It occurs when a pointer to a memory location within 
the local scope of a function "escapes" the function and 
is used outside it after the function has returned.
Recall an example from one of the previous steps:

```c++
int* escape() {
    int a = 42;
    return &a;
}

void escapeCaller() {
    int* p = escape();
    std::cout << (void*) p << "\n";
}
```

### Out-of-Bounds Access

Another memory-related bug we have already mentioned is _out-of-bounds access_.
Put simply, it is access to the memory outside the allocated range.

```c++
char* a = (char*) malloc(8);
// this is valid access
*(a + 2) = 1;
// this is out-of-bounds access
*(a + 9) = 2;
// this is out-of-bounds access too
*(a - 1) = 3;
```

### Memory Leak

In order to deallocate a dynamically allocated memory chunk, 
you need to have a pointer to it!
If you lose it somehow, you will not be able to deallocate the memory.
This programming error is known as _memory leak_.

To see an example of memory leak, consider the following function.

```c++
void leak() {
    char* p = (char*) malloc(8);
    std::cout << (void*) p << "\n";
}
```

It allocates an 8-byte memory chunk and then finishes.
However, the pointer to the allocated memory is neither returned
to the caller nor stored in some global variable.
It is, in fact, lost once the function finishes,
and thus, the allocated memory chunk leaks â€“ it can never be reclaimed.

### Use After Free

Once a memory chunk has been deallocated, 
an attempt to dereference the pointer that was referring to this memory chunk,
or an attempt to access the deallocated memory in any other way, 
would result in undefined behavior (and may cause program crash or data corruption in practice).

```c++
char* p = (char*) malloc(8);
free(p);
// undefined behavior
*p = 7;
```

### Double Free

Similarly, an attempt to deallocated memory a second time, 
after it has already been freed, can also cause troubles:

```c++
char* q = (char*) malloc(8);
free(q);
// undefined behavior
free(q);
```

### Detecting Memory Bugs

Of course, programmers have already invented some great tools that can help 
to find memory errors in your programs, and CLion IDE offers convenient 
integrations with such tools. 

The tools for finding memory-related bugs perform _runtime monitoring_ of your program. 
They inject into your program some additional checks to test that your program does not 
violate any rules of memory management. These checks are performed during the program run.
Therefore, usage of memory error checkers may come with some performance penalties. 
Because of that, they are usually enabled not by default but only during debugging or testing of the program.

There are two particularly popular tools that help to detect memory errors:
- [AddressSanitizer](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/google-sanitizers.html#AsanChapter)
- [Valgrind Memcheck](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/memory-profiling-with-valgrind.html)

Try to set up one of them (or both) in your IDE, using the CLion documentation (click the links above).
Then run the memory error checker on the program attached to this step, 
which contains all sorts of memory-related bugs mentioned here. 
The memory error detector should spot them all!
