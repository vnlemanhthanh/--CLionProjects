## Welcome to the C++ Basics course!

In this course, you are going to learn the fundamentals of this 
truly powerful language. 
As you may know, with great power comes great responsibility. 
In the case of C++, the responsibility lies on the programmer, that is, on you! 
Thus, you will learn not only how to use the C++ language, 
but also how some of its features work under the hood
in order to use them properly in your daily routine.

While doing so, you will also learn to work with the [Clion IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) â€“
a powerful tool that will help you to write and edit C++ code, 
navigate through the codebase, spot the errors in it, and do much more.
Occasionally, we will explicitly mention some IDE features during the course;
however, we recommend that you also explore 
[CLion learning materials](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/learn/) 
by yourself. You can find there many useful tips and tricks that will make 
your programming experience much more pleasant.
