In upcoming sections of this course, we are going 
to learn new features of the C++ language 
and continue to develop our little game. 

However, you don't have to wait for that –
if you wish, you can stay longer on this step and 
play with the code by yourself!
Embrace your creativity and implement in the game whatever you prefer!

For this task, we made the `main.cpp` file editable –
you can now modify and experiment with it.
