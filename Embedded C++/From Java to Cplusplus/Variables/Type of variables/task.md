# Type of variables

In C++, a program declares variables that are strongly typed, as in Java. 
However, type conversions tend to be more permissive and programmers should 
be very careful when manipulating variables of different types.

In the recent version of C++, the programmer can also use type inference, 
leaving the job of determining the type of the variables to the compiler, by 
using the `auto` keyword. In any case, types are known at compilation time 
and each variable declared in the program has a type that belongs to one of 
the built-in types or to classes defined in libraries or by the programmer. 

More information about `auto` will be given in a following task.
