# Introduction

## Java and C/C++
Although Java and C++ share some common grounds, they are essentially 
different in the way programmers may write programs that meet some quality 
standards. While C and C++ were designed for getting programs that run as 
fast as possible, Java's main priority was to reduce risks of writing bad 
programs.

Programmers with Java skills that start programming in C++ or 
programmers with little programming experience must be aware 
that C++ is not designed to help you write correct code. Java does introduce 
a lot of safety checks that slow down the execution of the code. C and C++ 
do not execute safety checks for reaching faster execution at the price that 
incorrect code will not be detected at compile time and produce errors that 
are difficult to debug.

## What is C++
C++ is a powerful programming language that is a combination of high level 
programming (Java) and low level programming (C). It was developed in 1979 at 
Bell Labs as an enhancement to the C programming language, while maintaining 
backward compatibility with C.

The C++ programming language is fast, just like C, and is the preferred 
programming language with C for embedded systems. Like Java, it provides objet 
oriented programming mechanisms, like classes, polymorphism, exception handling, 
strong typing, or templates. Among differences as compared to Java, it also 
offers operator overloading and does not provide built-in memory management 
(Garbage collector). It is also not meant for running programs through a virtual 
machine.

## C++ for programming of embedded systems
The programs for embedded systems are usually developed at a relatively low 
level. The lowest level would be the Assembly language. However, for improved 
portability and development efficiency, C++ is often preferred. It is easier to 
learn, portable and allows easy handling of data structures. Although direct 
control and access to instructions and memory may be an advantage, it is rarely 
required. In addition to the advantages of the C programming language, C++ also 
offers the advantages of objet oriented programming, in particular encapsulation 
of low level concepts in portable and easy to use classes.
