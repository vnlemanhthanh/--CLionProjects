# Manipulation of `std::string` instances

This code snippet checks if a string is a palindrome or not. For this, a 
method to delete all spaces in a string (`eraseSpaces()`) and to lower all 
characters (`toLowerCase()`) are written as well.

Observe how `toLowerCase()` uses the iterator `std::string::iterator` to 
access each character. Read the official documentation of the [std::string]
(https://cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/) and complete the code snippet.

The `main()` method should be able to run without errors and produce the 
expected results on the console.
