# Arrays and vectors in C++

The code should display the following result for each call to `starsArrays` 
and `starsVector`:
```
*****
****
***
**
*
```
For implementing both methods, use a multidimensional array. The base number of 
stars is given in advance and permits to allocate the first dimension. The 
second dimension is dynamically allocated during runtime so that the array's 
size corresponds to the needs. 

The first method uses the standard array whereas the second method uses vectors.

The `main()` method should be able to run without errors and produce the 
expected results.
