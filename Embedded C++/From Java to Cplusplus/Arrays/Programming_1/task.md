# Arrays and vectors in C++

Here is a small exercise to work with the array in C++.
- The `min()` method searches the min value of the array. A fixed sized 
  array on the stack is used.
- The `max()` method searches the max value of the array. A fixed sized 
  array on the heap is used. Remember how the array's space on the heap must 
  be freed.
- The `swap()` method reverse the array values into a new array. For example,
  { 1, 2, 3, 4} becomes { 4, 3, 2, 1} and { 2, 4, 3} becomes {3, 4, 2}. 
  You may of course use vector's methods for implementing the method.

The `main()` method should be able to run without errors and produce the 
expected results.
