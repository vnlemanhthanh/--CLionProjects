title: Embedded C++
language: English
summary: "This is an introductory C++ course for programming embedded systems.   The\
  \ course is a support for programming lectures that use C++ as programming language\
  \ at HEIA-FR / HES-SO. The course covers core C++ features targeting in particular\
  \ programming of embedded systems. \n\nThis course offers exercises that will be\
  \ done in part during class time. It is a complement to the course given in the\
  \ classroom and not a   replacement. \n\nThe exercises present theoretical concepts\
  \ using   examples, propose programming problems to be solved and answers to be\
  \ given to questions (in the form of multiple choices). \n\nThe prerequisites for\
  \ this course are basic C programming skills. The course sometimes refers to Java\
  \ concepts for students with a Java background. However, Java programming skills\
  \ is not a prerequisite to the course."
